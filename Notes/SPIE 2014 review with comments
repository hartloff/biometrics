(1) Genuine concerns we can address

As a snapshot of "work in progress," this paper represents a reasonable contribution.

-Stress that our paper presents a work in progress


The technique is not compared with the state-of-the art nor with relevant related techniques. 

-We reference other results


Looking at Table 1, we see that for the proposed system the BEST FRR is 19%, and the 
worse is 57%. These numbers clearly show that the proposed approach is unstable for even its lowest 
security setting.

The experiments are the weakest part of this paper.

A bit more effort is required to bring the error rates down to something acceptable. At this stage, FVC2002 is a 
fairly well studied data set, with even template protection algorithms achieving error rates that are often orders 
of magnitude lower than what is reported here.

-New stuff gets better numbers. Only report DB1 and DB2 like every other paper ever.


The basic approach of triangle and angles as a fixed representation is not novel yet they do not compare 
to nor meaningful discuss other protected triangle based approaches. E.g. it does not cite or discuss the 
most relevant paper: Li, P., Yang, X., Qiao, H., Cao, K., Liu, E., & Tian, J.  "An effective biometric 
cryptosystem combining fingerprints with error correction codes." Expert Systems with Applications, 
39(7), 6562-6574, (2012). 

-multiple enrollment etc

With respect to Figure 4, the statement "The sharp drop in the graph is reflective of the very low 
FRRÕs, which approach 0 quickly as the score increases." is backwards.. it is because of the FRR 
approaches 1 as the score increases (the FRR approach 0 only when the system accepts all matches without 
any regard to biometrics).

-Reword/redo it or remove this comment entirely. 

Looking at Table 1, to me it is clear the proposed approach is unusable for any practical, for even its 
lowest security setting the FAR is too high and the FRR of 20-50% means it is unusable. I find it ironic 
that the introduction states the answer is affirmative and then goes on to cites prior work by some of the 
authors and and states quote Another issue with most such secure hash functions is that, even though these 
schemes have provable security, the security only works at parameter regimes that are not useful in practice.[6] 
quote Then presents a model where there is NO parameter regime that is useful even with minimal security.

-The EER's we quote are bad for practice, but we can get better now. Our security is valid (assuming we handle the ZeroFAR issue) at any
 operating point since the security analysis assumes breaking one triplet breaks the fingerprint so we claim 
 no extra security by adjusting the threshold as is the case in fuzzy vault.


The paper discussion discounts/dismisses the existing security analysis of template protection 
system, then presents an analysis that makes unjustified and obviously flawed assumptions. It is better 
for the field for papers to have no analysis than to have a misleading/incorrect theory or 
pointless proofs.

The security analysis of the paper is flawed in multiple ways. It makes assumptions that do not hold 
for biometrics and hence, is irrelevant. As discussed in the literature (e.g. (Scheirer, Walter J., 
and Terrance E. Boult. "Bipartite biotokens: Definition, implementation, and analysis." Advances 
in Biometrics. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2009. 775-785. http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-01793-3_79), 
the FAR for a given operation point is an inherent lower bound for security in any privacy enhanced 
template system. The only meaningful operating points for security system claiming 30 bits of security 
FAR < 2^-30, many orders of magnitiude below what is shown. It may also be worth noting that the 
aforementioned paper by Scheirer et al, says it is an extension of fuzzy vaults and reports better 
accuracy than [4], thus it should probably should be discuss if the authors rework this paper for publication.

The analysis on end of page 9 and top of 10, has no theoretical justification and provides no lower 
bound on attack probability using the minutiae distribution. The fact that they have non-zero FAR 
for all operating points tested shows that the security model presented does not apply to their 
problem. If their analysis applied, the chance of a hashes single false-match, would be less than 
1 in a billion. Instead, their experiments show that there are enough matching hashes so that the 
set-intersection is large enough to get a non-zero false match rate with only 4950 imposter tests.

The conclusion that the only means to get triangles is through exhaustive search of the 
input bit space, is not a conclusion, it is an assumption in a unrealistic security model analysis. 
The exhaustive search would have to be on the effective input space. While the authors finally hint at 
an understanding of this on page 9, where they state Another subtle issue is that, in reality, 
the distribution of the fingerprint templates is not uniform, and each fingerprint minutiae point has 
very limited entropy (bits). quote They don't demonstrate an understanding of it as they ignore 
their own experiments that show their models are wrong. This issues is not subtle, its fundamental in 
biometrics and it means the formal theorems simply do not apply to their problem. Allowing these 
irrelevant security analysis to be published would be at best misleading.

The experiments are poorly presented and make invalid claims The algorithm, with very discrete score 
parameter, misuses the term EER. The Equal error rate has a formal definition and it is NOT what the 
authors define it as. Instead the authors use the half-total-error rate HTER=(FAR+FRR)/2 at a particular 
operating point where they system is not secure and call that the EER so they can claim better ERR than 
prior papers. While I believe the HTER (or TER) at a particular operating point is a viable measure, it 
has to be at a quote secure quote operating point, which given the size of their testing must be FAR=0. 
Since the experiment does not report when FAR=0 its hard to say, but for DB1, it looks like a score of 4 
or 5, where they then have FRR of 40% to 50%. While this TER at zero FAR is not what is described in 
Scheirer et al quote s 2009 ICB paper, one can estimate it from their tables which report a 97% TAR 
(hence 3% FAR) at zero FAR for DB1 and DB2. If for some reason one did want to use ERR rates for protected 
template systems, then the state of the art on FVC2002 DB1 and DB2 are on the order of 1.2% and 2% 
respectively, or about an order of magnitude better than the HTER reported here.

-Report ZeroFAR. Mention the difference between template security and system security


(2) Genuine concerns we can't address

In particular the paper presumes that SHA256 is collision free and then in theorem 4.2 presume the 
random oracle model means samples are uniformly sampled from the full hash domain. Even given the 
former assumption on SHA256, the latter assumption of uniformality in the full range is not true, 
since the inputs are far from dense -- the domain of the hash cannot be larger than the range of 
the input.

-Need to address this somehow. Maybe compute the entropy of the histogram. We should look at all the various 
distributions and decide how to deal with this.



(3) Commenter didn't understand what we said

Sec. 5.2 is possibly flawed; the reported EER for fuzzy vault is 1, which is the worst possible case. I suggest that 
the implementation be reviewed for correctness, or this analysis be dropped from the paper, since it is simply showing 
that the fuzzy vault completely fails in this experimental regime, and doesnÕt add anything meaningful.

-We should reword this to be more explicit. Also, an EER of 1 is a perfect system that simply needs to reverse the final decision.
An EER of 1 would make us famous.


(4) Comment not relevant

The paper quotes presentation of its results are unacceptable.

This paper looks at a template protection scheme relying on a secure hash function. In particular, the algorithm 
makes use of minutiae triangles, which have been analyzed before in the context of such problems. The design of 
the algorithm combines clustering ideas from matching algorithms with ideas from the provable security of hash 
functions, and also applies an intermediate translation-invariant but rotation-variant map to the minutia points 
before applying the hash function. The paper tells us that this latter idea helps improve the tradeoff between 
matching accuracy and matching efficiency.

This work extends previous work by this group on search for hashes of fingerprints that have a better tradeoff 
between provable security and achievable practical matching accuracy.

The paper also considers practical concerns related to space complexity for the proposed approach and fuzzy vaults.


(5) Undecided

It might also be relevant to compare with the state of the art template protection 
schemes, e.g. see Yang, B., Busch, C., de Groot, K., Xu, H., & Veldhuis, R. N. (2012). Performance evaluation
 of fusing protected fingerprint minutiae templates on the decision level. Sensors, 12(5), 5246-5272, 
 not older papers that are no longer state of the art.
 
 -Gotta read that paper
 
 
 At a minimum they should have reported results on FVConGoing quote Secure Template Fingerprint Verification 
 (see https://biolab.csr.unibo.it/FvcOnGoing) where there are multiple systems properly tested on blind data.

-Maybe we can pull this off... maybe.

REVIEWER'S COMMENTS:

- Review of quote Secure fingerprint hashes using subsets of local structures quote

This paper has major flaws and is not unpublishable (in any forum) and it cannot be corrected within a 
reasonable time frame, if ever.

This paper presents yet another triangle-based quote secure quote template approach. The technique is 
not compared with the state-of-the art nor with relevant related techniques. The paper quote s security 
analysis is inherently flawed, and the experimental analysis misuses terminology and uses that to draw 
invalid conclusions. Looking at Table 1, we see that for the proposed system the BEST FRR is 19%, and the 
worse is 57%. These numbers clearly show that the proposed approach is unstable for even its lowest quote 
security quote setting. The paper quote s presentation of its results are unacceptable.

The paper stated off with the motivating question:

quote Is it possible to design secure hash functions that exploit the geometry of fingerprints for better
 matching accuracy as well as have provable security for parameter regimes that are needed in practice? quote


Looking at Table 1, to me it is clear the proposed approach is unusable for any practical, for even its 
lowest security setting the FAR is too high and the FRR of 20-50% means it is unusable. I find it ironic 
that the introduction states the answer is affirmative and then goes on to cites prior work by some of the

- This paper looks at a template protection scheme relying on a secure hash function. In particular, the algorithm 
makes use of minutiae triangles, which have been analyzed before in the context of such problems. The design of 
the algorithm combines clustering ideas from matching algorithms with ideas from the provable security of hash 
functions, and also applies an intermediate translation-invariant but rotation-variant map to the minutia points 
before applying the hash function. The paper tells us that this latter idea helps improve the tradeoff between 
matching accuracy and matching efficiency.

Positives:
+ This work extends previous work by this group on search for hashes of fingerprints that have a better tradeoff 
between provable security and achievable practical matching accuracy.
+ As a snapshot of "work in progress," this paper represents a reasonable contribution.
+ The paper also considers practical concerns related to space complexity for the proposed approach and fuzzy vaults.

Negatives:
- The experiments are the weakest part of this paper.

A bit more effort is required to bring the error rates down to something acceptable. At this stage, FVC2002 is a 
fairly well studied data set, with even template protection algorithms achieving error rates that are often orders 
of magnitude lower than what is reported here.
