IJCB - April 10



Thoughts on a Multi-modal approach
-Indexing might be trivial using the same approach as with fuzzy vault but with straight hashing
 *we should implement indexing on our current scheme that uses straight hashing
-We can adjust the number of bits for each modality to change the weight for that modality. 
Adjust iris for high matching weight while face and fingerprint mostly pad the security numbers.
-Convert vectors to sets by tagging each piece. Tag doesn’t add security. Tagging all the way 
down to individual bits leads to a system where the set intersection is the (n - the) hamming distance of the original vector.
