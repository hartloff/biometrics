===========================================
== Security concerns to keep in mind: =====
===========================================
1. No combination of data from multiple enrollments by the same individual should be able to be combined 
   to recover the biometric template data or to generate a spoof.
   
2. If any non-biometric data that is used to encode/decode (e.g. link table), or is released by the system 
   (e.g. key), is known, the biometric template must not be recoverable nor should it allow hill-climbing or spoof generation.
   
3. It should not be possible for two users to authenticate against the same token with significantly higher frequency
   than the system's documented False Accept Rate.
   
4. No undetected substitution of records should be possible.

5. Any data transmitted outside the system, except during enrollment, should not be suitable to link
   the underlying user over space/time/companies.
